This project was pretty much born as an excuse for practicing my knowledge on basic HTML + Vanilla JS. It ended up quite nicely I'd say.

I decided to make it based on [Helltaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/), which is a free game that came up recently that people really liked it, if you want to give it a try it's [free](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/) on Steam.

The project was heavily inspired by [Satania.moe](https://satania.moe/), since it has such a wonderful boilerplate and design for the page I wanted to make. Props to [Pizzacus](https://github.com/Pizzacus/).
