Ever been on a roller coaster that just doesn't seem to stop? Yeah, that's been my life lately.

Take a peek at my [Github contribution graph](https://github.com/Nsttt) and you'll find a barren landscape. My once somewhat vibrant field of green squares, each marking a day of my life dedicated to coding, is now just a digital ghost town.

Why the sudden change in scenery, you ask? Life happened. And not just the usual life-stuff, but a _gigantic_, heaping helping of it. I'm talking about the kind of work that makes your plate look like a Thanksgiving dinner for giants.

Here's the deal. I’ve been diving headfirst into a sea of projects that have stretched me to my limits. The responsibilities have been numerous, the deadlines merciless, and there's a whole battalion of folks counting on me to do my bit so they can do theirs.

On top of that, there's the silent weight of my own ambition. I'm not just in this for the thrill of the game. I've set my sights on **loftier goals**. I'm aiming to climb the career ladder, not just for the view from the top, but to hoist my team and my company up there with me. I'm striving to mold my colleagues into better engineers, support my company's rise to the top, and carve out a niche in the tech world where we can proudly stake our claim.

But, with everything spinning around me like a tornado of responsibilities, something had to give. And looking at my desolate Github graph, it’s clear what took the hit.

It's not a sight for sore eyes, but it's the wake-up call I needed. Looking at my barren field was like catching my reflection and not recognizing the person staring back. It was a reality check that I had been so swept up in the hurricane of work that I’d lost touch with a vital part of myself.

But here's the thing: I’m not about to let the story end here. This isn't a tale of defeat, but a call to action.

## Lost and Found: My Love for Open Sourcing

Picture this: You're standing in a room filled with tech maestros. The air is buzzing with energy, ideas are whizzing around, and the sheer talent in the room is nothing short of jaw-dropping.

But let's rewind a bit, to a time when my enthusiasm for open sourcing was running on fumes. Why, you ask? Two words: **impostor syndrome**. Yeah, that sneaky little voice that whispers, "_You don't belong here_" every time you’re in the presence of super talented colleagues. When you're navigating the vast tech sea, it's easy to feel like a tiny fish, completely out of your depth. And let me tell you, it's a crummy feeling.

Now, fast forward to JSDay at Canarias. You might have heard of it - it's only one of the coolest tech conferences out there! But for me, this wasn’t just a conference. It was the life-raft that pulled me out of my self-doubt and put the wind back in my open sourcing sails.

Why? Because I had the chance to rub shoulders with some of the biggest names in the industry. I'm talking about the likes of **[Kent](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)**, **[Tejas](https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_)**, [**Aleksandra**](https://twitter.com/aleksandrasays), **[Sandrina](https://twitter.com/a_sandrina_p)**, and my T3 community buddy, **Stoyko**. Just being in their presence was like mainlining a hefty dose of motivation.

Their passion, their creativity, their drive, it was all so contagious. It was as if they reached into me and reignited the dormant flame of my love for open sourcing. I saw in them a reflection of who I used to be and who I knew I could be again.

So this post? Consider it a massive shout-out to this stellar gang. A heartfelt thanks for being my guiding light in the foggy sea of self-doubt. Their brilliance not only lit up the path but also sparked a fire within me, reminding me of my love for open sourcing and why I chose this path in the first place.

## The Comeback Plan

Alright, let's switch gears and talk about my life calendar from [WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

To some, it might seem a bit grim. Imagine a calendar filled with tiny boxes for each week of your entire life. It’s like a visual timeline from your birth date to... well, let's just say a very, very long time from now. Some of my friends look at it and get cold sweats. But for me, it's more like a treasure map.

Yeah, seeing your whole life laid out might freak some folks out. But me? I see stories. Each little box is a week of wins, losses, lessons, and adventures. It's like a diary, but instead of "_Dear Diary_" entries, there are tick marks for every week I've lived.

For me, it's not a countdown to doom. It's a progress bar. It's a tool that shows me where I've been and where I'm going. When I hit a slump, like these past two months, it's a kick in the pants. It's a wake-up call saying, "_Hey, get back in the game and back to work!_"

So yeah, my life calendar isn’t a ticking time bomb of anxiety for me. It’s more like a coach, a cheerleader, and a reality check all rolled into one. It keeps me focused, driven, and excited for what's coming next.

First on the agenda: getting my tasks in order. I mean seriously noting them down, prioritizing them. It's a simple trick, but it takes the load off my mind and keeps things running smoothly.

Next, I need to give my personal projects the love they deserve. No more endless idea scribbles that lead nowhere. I’m talking about getting down to business, committing to see things through from start to finish, even when the going gets tough. It's high time my projects stop gathering dust at the “just started” phase.

As I set off on this new journey, I’m excited to find that balance again – between life and work, discipline and freedom. It’s not going to be easy, but then again, what’s life without a little challenge, eh?
