## **The Trigger for Change**

I am a tech enthusiast, I am constantly on the lookout for the latest advancements in technology. Every day brings a flood of new information, and honestly, it's more than I can handle sometimes.

For years, I've been moving through Twitter, X (thanks, Elon), Youtube, ByteByteGo, and more. Add to that the roster of tech content creators, shoutout to [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg), [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen), or [Melkey](https://www.youtube.com/@MelkeyDev).

It's overwhelming. Cool, but overwhelming.

I've got stuff to do and this chaos is killing my focus.

So, after many discussions with my good friend [Oriol](https://oriolrius.me/), about a year ago, I decided to take control and start my own digital notebook.

Initially, I went with [Notion](https://notion.so), as it was familiar and somewhat effective, but it lacked certain features I needed and often lagged, which was frustrating. Then, an idea struck. I remembered [Obsidian](obsidian.md) a tool that had been on my radar for a while. It was appealing, especially the idea of owning my files as plain markdown, but the learning curve looked complicated. Despite that, I decided to dive in and see what I could make of it.

My files were a mess, scattered across folders with random nesting, creating chaos in the root of my vault. The plugin system kinda helped in some cases, most when I decided to invest some time into it. Suddenly, I could integrate tools like [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) directly into Obsidian, saving money and keeping everything local. Game changer.

This last bit is more important than it seems, thanks to discovering said plugin I got to met Zsolt.

## **Developing a Personal Knowledge Management System**

Zsolt is the brains behind the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin and a creator of content on YouTube focused on Personal Knowledge Managers (PKM). His channel was a goldmine, exactly what I needed to see.

Inspired by several videos and the broader PKM community, I've built my own kind of management system. Here’s what I came up with.

## **Detailed Breakdown of Note Types**

My workflow consists of three parts: how I write notes, where I save them, and the habits I've cultivated.

1. **Manual Notes**: Like this very article. Each note includes metadata like timestamps and tags to keep my graph organized and sometimes, more specific metadata for particular cases.
2. **Clippings**: The bulk of my vault. Remember the daily info madness? It’s manageable now, thanks to the 'Obsidian clipper'—a plugin I developed (find it on my GitHub!). It captures full page metadata, creating detailed notes that help me recall and review later. It's a bit lacking still, I kinda need to update it.
3. **Habits**: Here’s where it gets a bit wild. Monday through Friday, my vault is a chaotic mess—notes everywhere, no real order. Come the weekend, I sort through the week's accumulation, organizing and refining as I go.

## **Exploring the Folder Structure**

For my folder, I use a hybrid system inspired by PARA and Zettelkasten, to fit my style.

- **0. Maps**: This is essentially the dashboard of my vault. It's where I visualize analytics and other overview elements of my note collection. Although it's still fairly poor, since I don't have many notes made here yet.
- **1. Projects**: Here, projects are just projects; they're ideas and initiatives I'm actively working on or planning. I prefer to keep individual notes rather than folders here to maintain simplicity.
- **2. Areas**: This section is to store different types of notes that need to be isolated from the general pool. For example, I keep all the architecture documents and diagrams for Nexiona, my current employer, here.
- **3. Resources**: This folder is like my second brain, really. Here I drop everything I find interesting every day, most of my notes lie in here and they're structured in many different folders; Tweets, books, articles, webpages, OSS tools, videogames, videos, tools, slides, prompts, manuals, documents… The list goes on.
- **4. Permanent**: To me, permanent notes are a kind of note that are meant to be hydrated from time to time yet do never die. Here lies for example my 'people' folder where I a list of the people I know and care about. Some meeting notes that I think need to be saved, or some diagrams that I find relevant to keep in hand.
- **5. Fleeting**: As the name suggests, this folder is for ephemeral notes that are relevant only for a short period. These include brief ideas, temporary observations, and initial thoughts that either evolve into more substantial notes or get discarded.
- **6. Daily**: My daily notes, split into two main parts: general notes and to-dos. Each day gets its own note, each one has relevant stuff I've done on the day and a to-do list that rolls over to the next day, thanks to a handy plugin.
- **7. Archives**: This is where notes go to retire. It mirrors the main structure almost completely but is reserved for notes that are no longer active or relevant.
- **8. Meta**: This folder is a bit of a backstage area. It houses templates and static elements like images that I embed in other notes.

## **Conclusion**

I've been talking about Obsidian for a while to some friends, and I've told them many times I'd like to share this in an Obsidian Post. So here it is. Hope you enjoyed.
