This was pretty much on of my very early projects. In fact, it was partially broken until not long ago, when I asked a friend to help me out fix it.
It came out nicely in fact, thereâ€™s a few things that could be improved, like the way sorting works and the actual display and organisation of the different lists. But **if it works it works**.

The project uses React, [ChakraUI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), a really clean component library and [use-http](https://github.com/ava/use-http), a hooks-based fetch library for isomorphic http requests.

The idea for the project came from a Youtube video from [Kamran Ahmed](https://github.com/kamranahmedse), with a few aditions made by my side.
Which in my opinion has one of the best roadmaps for every developer there is, you can check that roadmap [here](https://roadmap.sh/) if you want.
