**IoT Gateway** is a next-generation platform engineered to simplify the deployment, management, and monitoring of Industrial IoT infrastructures. Built on robust open-source technologies, it delivers a comprehensive solution—from automated provisioning to real-time observability—making it ideal for both remote facilities and industrial deployments.

## Why IoT Gateway?

- **Effortless Deployment:** USB-free, zero-touch setup with network booting and centralized provisioning
- **Streamlined Management:** Full control over system configuration, container deployment, and network settings through a user-friendly web interface
- **Robust Observability:** Real-time monitoring, centralized logging, and advanced performance dashboards
- **Seamless Recovery:** Automated backups, live debugging, and rapid restoration
- **Flexible Integration:** Connect OT devices with Layer 2 VPN and bidirectional MQTT synchronization

## Core Capabilities

### Provisioning & Automation

- **USB-Free Setup** with iPXE network booting
- **Automated Provisioning** via Ansible Forms and JSON-configured playbooks
- **GitOps-Powered Stack Deployment** with automated Notion sync
- **Customizable OpenWRT Base Image** (~100MB) with modular updates

### Management & Monitoring

- **Intuitive Web-Based System Management** for Docker containers, firewall rules, and network settings
- **Grafana Alloy Suite** with Mimir and Loki for unified logging and metrics
- **Uptime Kuma & Autokuma** for automated service monitoring
- **Real-time dashboards** with Prometheus-compatible endpoints

### Networking & Connectivity

- **Secure Networking** via ZeroTier VPN and bridged networks
- **Layer 2 VPN** for non-IP-compatible industrial devices
- **Unified Namespace** with bidirectional MQTT synchronization (Mosquitto ↔ EMQX)

### Recovery & Debugging

- **Automated Backups** with Duplicati for disk imaging and snapshots
- **Zero-Touch Recovery** via network boot
- **Remote Live Debugging** with Clonezilla environment and SSH access

## Technical Architecture

IoT Gateway bridges Operational Technology (OT) and cellular networks with:

- Isolated communications for HMIs, PLCs, and manufacturing assets
- Expandable connectivity with Ethernet switches
- Layer 2 VPN for remote device discovery and management
- Git-integrated Node-RED automation
