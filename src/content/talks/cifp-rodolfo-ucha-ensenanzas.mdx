A candid session with students at CIFP Rodolfo Ucha. I walk through my career path—the wins and mistakes that opened doors—and how they can replicate it: what to learn first, how to build a portfolio that shows real skills, where to find opportunities, and what to prioritize in interviews. I also cover why collaborating with community, writing about what you learn, and choosing projects that tell a clear story to employers makes such a big difference.
