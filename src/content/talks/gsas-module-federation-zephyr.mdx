10 milliseconds. That's not a build time—it's a production deployment. At Zephyr Cloud, we reimagined microfrontend delivery from first principles, building a platform where frontend updates ship at the speed of memory access. This talk reveals how we layer Module Federation with our edge-native runtime to achieve sub-second deployments, the pipeline architecture that makes 'push to prod' instantaneous, and the safety mechanisms that empower teams to move fast without the traditional risks. Learn how we eliminated the infrastructure tax on frontend releases and what it takes to make millisecond deployments production-ready.
