Pretty much one of my very early projects with React, just a simple Todo list with categories.

When I built it back in the day I decided it would be way better to have something different that every other tutorial around, so I invested some time on looking how exactly **localStorage** worked on the browser, and at the end, decided to store the Todos that way.
