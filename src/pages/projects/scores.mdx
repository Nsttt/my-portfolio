Although very simple I found nobody had made anything like this before.

In this game people keep track of huge scores of 100+ people MANUALLY to excel pages and other sheets. So I decided to make this app to make their life easier.

Functionally is very basic, just takes a screenshot from one of the scores and Tesseract OCR them into a pdf file so you can actually copy paste its data to anywhere else.
