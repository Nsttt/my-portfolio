# When it all started

I've never been a really passionate person to work many hours a day by my own. Until recently I felt the urge of start working right away. Not a big deal, I might not have discipline, but I believe on my own willpower when it comes to moments like this one.

So I started working. All went smoothly on day one, learned quite a few things, modified my schedule to make at least about 2-3 hours of work that day, outside of my other tasks.

I have to mention here that I'm a student, so I don't have a job a the moment and fortunately have LOTS of free time for doing whatever I want to.

### Day two.

I woke up rather tired from yesterday, so I decided to sleep a bit more, and left that morning to doing other stuff, played a few games, read a bit, watched some series. A bit of time of enjoyment for myself. After that I just made my lunch, eat, and it was time to get some work done.

Studied a bit, maybe an hour or so, and started coding a bit with the project I have started at the time, I remember it being something really simple to get started with Javascript, since I had some experience with C# before, I sort of knew what I was doing most of the time. Those were about 3 or 4 hours of work done that day.

### Day three.

On day 3 I woke up late. Like, really late, it was about 1 pm. Which is usually the time when I have my lunch. I woke up in a rush, leaving bed undone and room messy. Made my food and eat.

After that, cleaning my room before working is a must. And this is a point I want to explain a bit further.

**I do everything** on my room. And I mean all of it, I play on it, I relax on it, and I work on it as well as studying.

Dont take me wrong, I dont think it's a bad thing to do everything on one place, but just stay with me on this one, remember this part, it's important for what comes next.

As I was saying, I tidied everything up, and set myself to work. I worked about 2 hours that day.

Why only 2 hours you wonder?

Well, at the time I wanted to chat a bit with my friends and wanted to have some time for myself, and since I couldn't get up at the proper hour I just couldn't do all the things I wanted, so I spent the rest of the day playing games and having fun.

### Day four.

Nothing was done that day.

> Oh you know, It wasn't week day. Am not working on a Sunday. That's a free day I have to do whatever I want to, and have fun.

I thought.

### You can probably expect what happened the rest of the days following this one don't you ?

If you don't, lemme tell you.

I didn't do shit for pretty much a whole week after that.

And this process repeated itself about 5 to 10 times in a few months.

And this is what I came here to talk about.

### Things aren't as easy as they look.

From an inside perspective of my old me. Everything looked as easy as it gets.

> If people working 8 hours a day can get 1 or 2 hours of free time to do work by themselves, why wouldn't I be able to do it.

Fair premise, horrifyingly bad execution.

It's not. Working by yourself, when you have nobody around you to push you to keep working, is hard as hell. I didn't know that when I decided I wanted more than what school was teaching me.

So what did you do ? You might wonder. Well, mostly I wasted my time trying out methodologies of study or trying to setup many types of systems to keep myself focused working.

I recalled that was bollocks mostly when I started reading books. Famous books made by people who are incredibly proficient on what they do and they're insanely efficient workers.

I noticed many patterns, that when I applied them, mostly failed at the beginning, but they had something different.

I'm going to talk about a few of them, very concisely.

## About habits.

> Start before you're ready.

From my believes, habits need to be something normal. And by that I mean, you shouldn't make them something incredible that you're going to accomplish or something amazing that nobody else will ever do.

The more you think about it, the worse it will be in the long run.

Take it like something that you know. Deeply. That has to be done, and start doing it right away.

Not tomorrow, not next month or next week. **Right now.**

## Work because you like it.

Something I have noticed talking to other people, who like myself wanted to
